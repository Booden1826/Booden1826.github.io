<p>	I have always loved photography. When I was younger, I would </p>
<p>always take my Nana's camera and just go at it. I mean, I took pictures</p>
<p>of everything I saw or that interested me. </p>
<p>Sometimes I see the most beautiful picture in my eyes, but when I actually try</p>
<p>to take the picture it's nothing like what was in my head. In my head it was</p>
<p>brighter and more contrast than just on a smartphone. My photography differs from what </p>
<p>I think would be a great picture. </p>

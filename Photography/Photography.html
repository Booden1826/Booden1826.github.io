<p>This picture was taken when my family and I were on a boat to</p>
<p>Put-in-Bay for the weekend. It was sunset and my mom was </p>
<p>just standing there looking at the water. I thought it </p>
<p>looked beautiful so I told her to stay where </p>
<p>she was and I took the picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So this picture was taken in Beavercreek, when I was going </p>
<p>for a nice run at the park with my mom. As we we</p>
<p> ran there was a patch of yellow flowers, my </p>
<p>mom had to stop and wait for me to </p>
<p>take this picture.</p>

<p>This picture was taken at my house in Troy. This is</p>
<p>Blizzard, the hamster I had. He was standing </p>
<p>on the top of his wheel and he looked</p>
<p>so cute. I just had to take the</p>
<p>picture and it turned</p>
<p>out pretty good.</p>

<p>This picture was taken in Pennsylvania. It was a city view </p>
<p>of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania from a mountain.</p>
<p>I was with my mom and her boyfriend</p>
<p>Chip. I did get a little scared though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This picture was taken in Michigan at my</p>
<p>Nanas house. My little sister Grace and I </p>
<p>were swimming and that was the day she got</p>
<p>brave enough to jump off the diving board. I</p>
<p>Layed on the gound and told her to jump in, and that's </p>
<p>how I got this picture.</p>

<p>This picture was taken in Florida when my boyfriend and I </p>
<p>decided to explore a lighthouse. I took this picture </p>
<p>right before going up. I was scared the whole </p>
<p>time and almost fell down the stairs, I will </p>
<p>never do this again but I took a nice picture</p>
